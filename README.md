# 🏏 Cricbuzz LiveStats: Real-Time Cricket Insights & SQL-Based Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
Cricbuzz LiveStats is a cricket analytics web application that integrates **real-time data from the Cricbuzz API** with a **SQL-based analytics engine**. The application provides live match updates, detailed player and team statistics, advanced SQL-driven insights, and full CRUD functionality through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **REST APIs, Python, SQL, and web application development** in the sports analytics domain.
